### Problem

When attending networking events, entrepreneurs and salespeople often meet numerous potential clients, partners, or leads. However, remembering key details about each person—such as their needs, pain points, and the context of your conversation—can be overwhelming. Without this context, it’s difficult to follow up effectively or nurture those relationships. As a result, valuable business opportunities and client connections are often lost, and maintaining a growing network of prospects becomes a time-consuming challenge.

### Solution

An application that will accept text and transcribe voice input, input details into a database about the person, and a browser extension that will:

* Generate LinkedIn notifications that will suggest who to interact with
* Suggestions on approaching the individual via message (for example, if there is news the person may be interested in)
* Suggestions in the notifications can be based on whether you're starting a project or looking for work
* Generate tooltips on the individual's LinkedIn, giving additional details about the person from the database

### Unique Value Proposition

<b>WhoRU?</b> stands out by going beyond basic contact management. While other tools simply store names and emails, <b>WhoRU?</b> is assisted by AI to capture the context—like interests, needs, and the specific value a person brings to your business. This makes follow-up more personalized and actionable, ensuring you never lose track of important details. Unlike traditional CRMs, <b>WhoRU?</b> is designed for simplicity, helping entrepreneurs and sales professionals build and nurture meaningful connections without the complexity of bulky systems.

### Existing Alternatives

* <b>LinkedIn</b> (and other Professional Networking Platforms)</b>: LinkedIn allows users to connect with professionals and keep track of their network in one place. It provides basic information on contacts, such as job titles, company names, and recent activity. However, LinkedIn is limited to only basic information—users often forget where they met someone, what they talked about, or the context of the interaction.

* <b>CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Systems</b>: CRMs like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Zoho allow users (especially salespeople or business development professionals) to track interactions with leads, clients, and prospects. However, CRMs are typically designed for business or sales use, not for personal networking. They tend to be overly focused on sales pipelines, rather than on casual networking or event-based connections.

* <b>Note-Taking Apps (Evernote, Notion, OneNote)</b>: Professionals use note-taking apps to jot down information after meeting new people at events or conferences. This can include details like names, company info, what was discussed, and any follow-up actions. However, these apps are not specifically designed for professional networking, so they require users to manually input data and remember to organize it.

* <b>Digital Business Cards (e.g., HiHello, CamCard)</b>: Digital business card apps like HiHello and CamCard help people exchange contact information instantly at networking events, which eliminates the need for physical cards. However, these apps typically only store basic contact info (email, phone number, LinkedIn link) and don’t offer deeper context or information about where or how you met.

* <b>Event-Specific Networking Apps (e.g., Bizzabo, Brella, Swapcard)</b>: Apps like Bizzabo, Brella, and Swapcard are designed to help attendees connect with one another at specific events like conferences or trade shows. They let attendees view attendee profiles, schedule meetings, and track who they’ve interacted with. However, these tools are event-specific, meaning they’re not useful for networking outside the context of the event. They don’t typically provide an ongoing, long-term solution for managing and following up with contacts after the event ends.

* <b>Calendar and Reminder Apps (Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook)</b>: Users often rely on their calendars to schedule networking events and set reminders to follow up with people they meet. However, these apps are not specifically designed for networking, so they don't provide the ability to store detailed interaction history, make suggestions for follow-up messages, or track ongoing relationships.

### Unfair Advantage

A large, continuously growing database of personal interactions and contextual information across professional events, something like a "personalized networking history" that could be tied to a user’s specific career journey. It’s something no other tool or network (like LinkedIn) can easily replicate, especially if this data is tagged with contextual insights (where you met, what topics you discussed, etc.).

Over time, your AI gets better at analyzing interaction patterns and suggesting networking opportunities based on nuances that aren’t immediately obvious, like shared interests or common professional challenges. Competitors may struggle to replicate this level of AI sophistication without significant investment and time.

Developing proprietary algorithms that add real-time data and suggestions directly into LinkedIn’s interface in a way that feels natural and useful. This level of integration and real-time data suggestion might be hard to imitate without permission or a similar level of access.

The more users we have, the better our AI gets at understanding networking patterns and suggesting interactions, which could give early users a better experience that draws in more users. This could create a kind of "lock-in," where users are reluctant to switch to another platform because the recommendations and insights have become too valuable.

Having exclusive integrations or collaborations with specific professional networks or events where people are most likely to network. If we integrate live event details, attendee information, and context directly into our app, it would be a competitive edge that other generic networking tools might not have access to.

A long-term, trusted relationship with users where they feel confident that our app is enhancing their networking strategy and career development, creating high user retention rates. The more people rely on our app to remember key details about their professional network, the harder it is for them to leave for a competitor.
